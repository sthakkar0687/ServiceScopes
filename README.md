Hi friends,

I have created this project to understand the different scopes of services like : Singleton, Scoped and Transient.

This is a very simple application.

Just run the project in visual studio. 

It will open the home page.

You can refresh and check the counts which are maintained in the different service scope types from their respective constructors.

Thank you
